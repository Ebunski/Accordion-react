## Overview

Features:

### Built with

- React javascript
- CSS custom properties and dynamically rendered css classes
- Flexbox and grid

## My process

- I went through the mobile and desktop styles on the css files
- Created the layout of the components
- Gave the page life with the magic of javascript.

### What I learnt

1. React:
   Learnt three ways to manage toggle of children:

   - making them manage their display states
   - controlling from parent using id and mapping through data changing the show property.
     _Note: Use of currId does not work in this case since the all inherit the same show state_

   Overall it was a very wonderful project.
